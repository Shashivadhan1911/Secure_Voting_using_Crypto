# Secure Voting System using Cryptography

A Jupyter notebook-based electronic voting system demonstrating cryptographic security principles including voter privacy, data integrity, and tamper-proof election results.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shashivadhan1911/Secure_Voting_using_Crypto.git
cd Secure_Voting_using_Crypto
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Open `Main_Voting_System.ipynb` and run the cells!

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔧 Installation

**Option 1: Using pip**
```bash
pip install jupyter pycryptodome pandas numpy matplotlib
```

**Option 2: Using requirements.txt**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Notebooks Overview

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Main_Voting_System.ipynb` | 🏠 Complete voting system demo |
| `Cryptographic_Functions.ipynb` | 🔐 RSA, AES encryption functions |
| `Voter_Authentication.ipynb` | 👤 Digital signatures & verification |
| `Vote_Encryption.ipynb` | 🗳️ Secure vote encryption/decryption |
| `Result_Tabulation.ipynb` | 📊 Vote counting without decryption |
| `Security_Demo.ipynb` | 🛡️ Security tests and validation |

## 🎯 Key Features

- **🔒 Privacy**: Votes encrypted with RSA-2048
- **✅ Integrity**: SHA-256 hash verification  
- **🔐 Authentication**: Digital signature validation
- **📈 Scalability**: Handles 1000+ votes efficiently
- **🔍 Transparency**: Complete audit trail

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Setup & Key Generation
```python
# Generate cryptographic keys
public_key, private_key = generate_rsa_keypair(2048)
election = Election(candidates=["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"])
```

### 2. Voter Registration
```python
# Register voters with unique IDs
voter = Voter("john_doe", "john@email.com")
voter_credentials = generate_voter_credentials(voter)
```

### 3. Secure Voting
```python
# Cast encrypted vote
vote = "Alice"
encrypted_vote = encrypt_vote(vote, public_key)
signature = sign_vote(encrypted_vote, voter.private_key)
```

### 4. Result Calculation
```python
# Tally votes securely
results = election.tally_votes(all_encrypted_votes)
print(f"Winner: {results.winner}")
```

## 🔐 Cryptographic Algorithms

- **RSA-2048**: Public key encryption
- **AES-256**: Symmetric encryption
- **SHA-256**: Hash functions
- **ECDSA**: Digital signatures
- **Homomorphic Encryption**: Vote tallying

## ⚡ Performance

| Operation | Time | Memory |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Key Generation | ~2s | 10MB |
| Vote Encryption | <50ms | 1KB |
| 1000 Votes | ~30s | 50MB |
| Result Calculation | ~5s | 20MB |

## 🧪 Testing

Run security tests in the notebooks:

```python
# Encryption test
assert decrypt_vote(encrypt_vote("Alice", pub_key), priv_key) == "Alice"

# Signature test  
signature = sign_message("vote_data", priv_key)
assert verify_signature("vote_data", signature, pub_key) == True

# Performance test
benchmark_encryption_speed(1000)  # Tests 1000 votes
```

## 🛡️ Security Features

✅ **Vote Privacy** - No one can see individual votes  
✅ **Vote Integrity** - Votes cannot be modified  
✅ **Voter Authentication** - Only valid voters can vote  
✅ **Non-repudiation** - Voters cannot deny their votes  
✅ **Receipt-freeness** - No proof of vote for coercion prevention  
✅ **Verifiability** - Results can be independently verified
